        Intriva Capital secures debt financing for refurbishment of iconic hotel on Spain’s Costa del Sol
        </h2>
    <h5 class='text-center'>
    The financing confirms the strength and potential of the project, which will see the hotel positioned as a
        luxury 200-bedroom resort
    </h5>
    <p class='my-3'>
        <b>London, 18 March 2021</b> — Intriva Capital (“<b>Intriva</b>”), the independent alternative asset manager,
        today announced that it has secured credit facilities, including a EUR 20 million tranche provided by the
        European Investment Bank through the Impacto Andalucia vehicle managed by Arcano Capital, for the refurbishment
        of the former Byblos Hotel in Mijas into a luxury 200-bedroom resort.
        <br/><br/>
        Intriva acquired the hotel, which had been closed for over 10 years, in 2019 and has been working with its
        professional team to create an exciting new offering. Following the acquisition, Intriva has partnered with
        Marugal Hotel Management, a leading luxury hotel management specialist, to oversee the operations. It has also
        signed a franchise agreement with a Hyatt Hotels Corporation affiliate as a part of The Unbound Collection,
        making it the first Hyatt-branded hotel in Southern Spain. The hotel is scheduled to open in late Spring 2022.
        <br/><br/>
        The project includes a full renovation and expansion of the existing property. Once the works are complete, the
        hotel will offer its guests a vibrant social offering in a relaxed luxury setting. The hotel will offer a range
        of amenities including a health club and spa, indoor and outdoor pools, night club, family facilities including
        a kid’s club, and exceptional conference spaces for private events and business meetings. The resort benefits
        from stunning views of the Sierra de Mijas mountain range and neighbours two 18-hole golf courses, originally
        designed by Robert Trent Jones.
        <br/><br/>
        Construction has commenced on site and works are progressing according to schedule.
        <br/><br/>
        As part of the redevelopment, a concerted effort has been made to ensure the hotel is more energy-efficient,
        while following the architecture and heritage of the old hotel and local area. The project is expected to
        provide a significant boost to the local economy, with over 200 jobs projected to be created, along with the
        ancillary benefits of increased high-end tourism.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Tom Saunders, Head of Asset Management at Intriva Capital, said:</b> “The ability to raise the required
        funding for this project is a clear validation of our plans to transform this asset into one of the Costa del
        Sol’s leading luxury hotels. We are delighted to have been able to secure a large amount of the funding via the
        European Investment Bank’s European Regional Development Facilities and the financing means we are well on track
        with the project and can aim to welcome the hotel’s first guests in the first half of next year.”

    <p>
        Intriva acquired Lending Works in July 2020 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform focused on
        matching borrowers with retail investors. P2P lenders grew rapidly after the global financial crisis.
        But savers gradually become more cautious, meaning that funding dried up. The problem became so
        severe that by Q1 2020, Lending Works was forced to suspend new lending. We could see that the
        company had the potential to originate a consistent pipeline of new loans, but it was paralysed by
        funding constraints.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        BUILDING THE TEAM
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        There was an opportunity to further strengthen the senior leadership team. We hired Jonathan Kramer
        as COO and head of a newly formed capital markets division. As President of Zopa, Kramer had
        successfully diversified the P2P lender’s funding base, raising capital via the institutional and
        wholesale markets.
        <br />
        <br />
        We appointed a new board director and non-executive chairman of the capital markets division.
        <br />
        <br />
        Intriva team members also joined the holding company board, enabling us to play a proactive role in
        developing and driving the new strategy. Other hires have included a new head of compliance in the
        capital markets division and several new roles in the analytics, data science and collections teams.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, we have identified the need for a chief product officer to act as a connection between
        credit risk, loan pricing, marketing, customers, and partners. This is an important new role, and our
        search is well progressed. We plan to make further hires throughout 2021 to scale the business.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        DIVERSIFICATION
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        Our first priority was to diversify the funding base. We recapitalised the business soon after acquiring
        it, and the funding base will be further diversified once we implement a warehouse line. This enabled
        the company to re-enter the lending market in Q1 2021. We have also started discussions for an onbalance sheet
        warehouse, with institutional business expected to come online during Q3 2021, subject
        to the necessary regulatory approvals. This will provide the deep and dependable source of funding
        that the company needs to thrive in future.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the lending side, the company has a strong track record on price comparison websites, as well as
        the ability to implement white label partnerships with household financial services brands. We have
        been improving the customer journey and forging new partnerships to distribute loan products
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
        INTERNAL CHANGES
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        We took the time to develop the strategy, build operational resilience and reset the business to
        commence limited lending under updated credit frameworks.
        <br />
        <br />
        We launched the capital markets division, hiring key roles within that team, as well as in risk and
        compliance. We also updated the company’s technology roadmap with support from external
        specialists, to independently challenge and verify against the existing and future needs of the business.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, we initiated a review of the brand, including defining the company’s purpose and ensuring
        that all branding aligns with our target customer base.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of external assistance, we brought in Hogan Lovells to help secure on-balance sheet lending
        permissions, and we expect them to provide longer-term legal, compliance and regulatory assistance
        as we scale.

        Partnership will also see Intriva provide significant new funding to support expansion
       </h5>
    <p class='mt-3'>
        <b>London, 24 February 2021</b> — Intriva Capital (“Intriva”), an independent alternative asset manager, today announced that it had acquired a significant stake and supported a management buy-out in MoneyPlus Group (“MoneyPlus”), one of the UK’s largest providers of consumer debt advice. Intriva will provide additional funding to further enhance the depth, breadth and value of services for MoneyPlus’ customers in a total investment program of £60 million.
    <br/><br/>
    MoneyPlus Group was founded in 2010 to help people who are struggling with their finances to find the right solutions to their problems. It has grown to become one of the UK’s largest providers of private debt advice and planning, working with over 50,000 customers each year. Alongside its core debt advice service, MoneyPlus Group also provides household energy solutions and legal services to its customer base. MoneyPlus is headquartered in Manchester, employs more than 170 people, and is regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). 
    <br/><br/>
    Intriva’s backing of the management buyout, led by Chris Davis, the longstanding Chief Executive of MoneyPlus Group, will accelerate the expansion of the company’s services to a wider range of customers across the country, at a time when debt advice is increasingly necessary. The existing MoneyPlus management team will continue in their existing roles. 
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Simon Finn, Managing Partner at Intriva Capital, commented:</b> “Chris and his team have successfully grown MoneyPlus to become a leader in its field with a reputation for understanding customer needs and acting with the upmost responsibility. This transaction is an opportunity for us to invest in a high-growth, dynamic business with a strong management team and an ambitious plan to support underserved markets and geographies.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Commenting, Chris Davis, Chief Executive Officer at MoneyPlus Group, said:</b> “When we began talking to the Intriva team, it was clear that they understood our business and broader sector and, perhaps most importantly of all, shared our core values and ethos of supporting customers fairly and responsibly at all times. With Intriva’s backing, we’ll continue to grow the business and help more people in need of financial advice and assistance.”
    <br/><br/>
    In December 2020, Intriva announced the acquisition of Lending Works, as well as the provision of significant additional funding to scale-up the lending platform’s operations. Lending Works has recruited former Zopa president Jonathan Kramer as Chief Operating Officer with a mandate to create a new institutional funding division.

        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
            Commenting on today’s announcement, David White, Partner at Intriva Capital, said:
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        “Our team’s identification of, and investment in, Node is a great example of our thematic investment strategy at
        work. From our offices in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain we continue to carefully deploy capital across
        Western Europe, helping companies like Node capitalise on current pricing dynamics and long-term demographic
        trends where we see strong demand and limited supply, while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our
        investors.”
        <br />
        <br /><br />
        He added: “The build-to-rent sector is a proven asset class, which has remained resilient throughout the recent
        market turmoil. Further, Node’s scalable proposition is well positioned to support changes to urban living and
        working across the European market.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Launched in 2016, Node was founded by property entrepreneur Anil Khera, formerly a Managing Director at
        Blackstone, where he launched the private equity firm’s European real estate capital markets group and helped
        establish the student housing platform Nido. Node owns and operates assets in seven locations around the world
        and has firmly established itself as a leader in the global build-to-rent market with its rapid expansion
        programme focussed on development and management of curated rental properties for millennials.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            Anil Khera, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Node, said:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        “We are delighted to be joining forces with Intriva through a joint venture that will help to power Node’s
        exciting expansion across Europe. The team at Intriva understands the unique opportunities in the build-to-rent
        sector and shares our vision and aspirations for Node. We are bringing the best-in-class offer we’ve
        successfully delivered in North America to Europe, helping to establish a new standard for urban living across
        the continent.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Latham & Watkins LLP and Deloitte advised Intriva on the transaction. Kirkland & Ellis LLP provided legal
        counsel to Node on the joint venture agreement.

        Intriva Capital acquires UK consumer credit company Lending Works
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>3 July 2020, London</b> — Intriva Capital (“Intriva”), an independent alternative investment manager
        focused on special situations, today announces its investment in Lending Works, the UK consumer credit and
        peer-to-peer lending business.
        <br />
        <br />
        The deal sees Intriva acquire 100% of the equity in Lending Works, subject to regulatory approval. Intriva has
        further committed to providing significant additional funding and capital to support the growth of the business
        following completion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Headquartered in London, Lending Works is the UK’s leading disrupter in providing consumer credit through
        partnerships. Launched in 2014, Lending Works has grown to become one of the largest alternative lenders in the
        UK having lent almost £250m to loan customers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nicholas Harding, founder and chief executive officer of Lending Works, will continue to lead the business,
        alongside the existing management team. The intention is Intriva’s Simon Finn, Dean Walsh and Tom Saunders, will
        join Lending Works’ board as non-executive directors.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Commenting on the acquisition, Simon Finn, Managing Partner at Intriva Capital, said:</b> “Under the
        leadership of founder Nick Harding, Lending Works has become one of the UK’s most successful challenger consumer
        credit businesses operating in the UK today. With a diversified funding base, the company is now in a position
        to realise the historical investment in the platform by continuing to offer great products, supported by
        market-leading technology and underwriting capabilities – so critical in the market conditions of today.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “The Intriva team has extensive operational experience managing and growing consumer lending businesses in the
        UK and across Europe. We will work in close partnership with Nick and his team, helping to expand the successful
        existing operations, while venturing into new areas and products where we collectively believe there are
        opportunities.”
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Nicholas Harding, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Lending Works, said:</b> “We are delighted to
        welcome the team at Intriva Capital as partners and colleagues, supporting Lending Works as it continues on the
        next exciting stage of its growth.
        <br />
        <br />
        “We set up the business six years ago in very different economic times, but demand for our proposition in the
        future will be stronger than ever. Intriva’s investment and expertise allows us to do this while enabling us to
        continue to innovate. This will ultimately help us to realise our ambition of becoming the market leader.”
        <br />
        <br />
