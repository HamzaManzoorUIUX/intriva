                                We seek market-leading investments that may be transformed through greater strategic and operational focus. We employ a proactive and theme-driven approach to sourcing investment opportunities, based on a firm culture which favours data-driven, independent, and evidence-based thinking. As a result, we typically originate investment opportunities outside the traditional sources of private equity deal flow. Further, we bolster these efforts with proprietary technology we have developed in order to streamline this process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We are patient in sourcing new investments and approach any transaction with thorough due diligence from the start of our analysis. We invest significant time during due diligence to identify weaknesses in various downside scenarioâ€™s and seek to prepare strategies should those events ever occur.  By the time any transaction completes, we have strong conviction coupled with a clearly defined path to exit and realisation.
